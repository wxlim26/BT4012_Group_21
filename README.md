## Motivation
In the ever-evolving field of fraud analytics, technological advancements have enabled increasingly sophisticated data-driven methods. However, progress in fraud detection has been matched by the relentless innovation of fraudsters, creating a perpetual cycle of adaptation. Car insurance has been a long-standing target for fraudulent activities, with insurance companies facing substantial monetary losses due to fraudulent claims. The General Insurance Association (GIA) of Singapore estimates that 20% of car-related damage claims are fraudulent (Araullo, 2023). 
Car insurance companies may choose to raise premiums for all policyholders as a hedge against losses from fraudulent claims. Through training and deploying various machine learning models, car insurance companies can proactively identify and reject fraudulent claims. This proactive approach not only alleviates the financial strain caused by fraudulent claims but also ensures swift and reliable processing of insurance claims, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and boosting overall company profits. Furthermore, by leveraging the power of a data-driven approach, insurers can uncover complex underlying patterns and anomalies within customer data that are often undetectable by humans. These data-driven insights will allow insurance companies to effectively stay one step ahead of evolving fraud tactics.
